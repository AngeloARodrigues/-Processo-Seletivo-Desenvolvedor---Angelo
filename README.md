# Farm Project 

The **Farm Project** is incomplete. 

We desire a project in which we could create farms, and search them according to some parameters.

In the frontend we already have a previous web application implemented in Angular 7, however, this application does still not allow that the user draws the farm in a map and sends it to the backend with some text parameters.

In the backend, we already have started the project using Django Rest Framework, and want you to implement some restrictions, and expand it to accept some parameters in the search.

In each folder on this project, you can find a Readme, there you will find some details about what is expected from you and a guide to install and start to program.

Good luck. We hope that you enjoy the project.
